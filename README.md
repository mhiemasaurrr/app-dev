**My Favorite movie series:**
- **Stranger Things** 🧑‍🔬
  - It is a science fiction horror drama that is released from Netflix.
It all started when a young psychokinetic girl named Eleven
escaped from the laboratory. Along with the vanishing of a kid named Will all the
mysteries from hawkins, Indiana started. It follows the story of a group of kids around whom strange supernatural events starts to unfold, as the result of an illicit science experiment gone wrong.
